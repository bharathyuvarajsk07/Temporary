Problem Statement



Raju is a young math enthusiast who loves to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. He recently learned about switch-case statements in programming and wanted to create a simple calculator program using them. Can you help Raju by writing a program that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation using switch case as input and performs the corresponding operation?

Input format :
The input consists of three lines:



The first line contains two integers, num1 and num2, separated by a space.

The second line contains a character, ch, representing the arithmetic operation to be performed.

The character can be one of the following: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.

Output format :
The output displays the result of the operation along with the operator, as shown in sample test cases.

Print "Invalid Operation" for other operators.



Refer to the sample output for the format specifications

Code constraints :
Both num1 and num2 are integers.

The arithmetic operation should be one of the valid characters: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 2
+
Output 1 :
The addition of the given numbers is 3.
Input 2 :
1 3
%
Output 2 :
Invalid Operation
Input 3 :
10 8 

Output 3 :
The division of the given numbers is 1.25.
Input 4 :
4 3
-
Output 4 :
The subtraction of the given numbers is 1.
Input 5 :
10 2
*
Output 5 :
The multiplication of the given numbers is 20.
