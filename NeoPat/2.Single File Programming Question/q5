The Westland Game Fair is the premier event of its kind for kids interested in some intellectual and cognitive brain games. Exciting games were organized for kids between the ages of 8 and 10.



One such game was called the "Triangle game", where different number boards in the range of 1 to 180 are available. Each kid needs to select three number boards, where the numbers on the boards correspond to the angles of a triangle.
