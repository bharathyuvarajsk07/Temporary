Carrom is a board game where two participants (teams) play. It consists of 9 white coins, 9 black coins, and a red coin. The first team to finish all their coins wins (given that red has been pocketed by one of the teams). The points are awarded based on the number of left-over coins from the losing team on the board. If the winning team has pocketed the red, they get an additional 5 points.
